# AGENTS.md

Rules, conventions, and architectural boundaries for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a multi-agent system that transforms Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) into patient-specific, FHIR-compliant, actionable care plans on the Red Hat AI platform. See [`dev_docs/`](dev_docs/) for the full project proposal and architecture slides.

## Architectural Boundaries

These are hard rules. Do not violate them.

### Component Ownership

- **`cpg-ingester`** has two outputs: (1) DMN decision tables for computable logic, and (2) recommendations and other non-computable content destined for a vector store in `acp-writer`. It must not be coupled to the decision engine runtime or vector store implementation. It interacts with downstream services only through API/MCP. The recommendation contract is defined in `shared/cpg_contracts/recommendations.py` — see `dev_docs/contract-proposal-ingester-writer.md` for the full design rationale.
- **`acp-writer`** owns the Drools/Kogito decision engine runtime and the vector store. Both are internal implementation details of `acp-writer` — they are not platform services. It deploys and executes DMN. It produces two outputs: FHIR CarePlans (to the FHIR server) and BPMN (to automation). The API contract is defined in `acp-writer/api/openapi.yaml` (REST) and `acp-writer/api/mcp-tools.json` (MCP tools). Callers provide patient data directly — acp-writer does not query FHIR servers.
- **`automation`** is a downstream runtime service that executes BPMN process definitions. It does not orchestrate other services.
- **`mock-EHR`** is development/test infrastructure. It is not application logic.
- **`platform`** holds shared infrastructure services (MaaS, MLflow) that multiple application components consume. These are platform-level dependencies, not application logic. On OpenShift AI, these are typically configured rather than deployed; for local dev, this directory contains the deployment artifacts.
- **`shared`** holds cross-component contracts and utilities. Use it sparingly to prevent coupling between components.

### Standards as Contracts

Each component boundary uses a standards-based contract:

| Boundary | Standard | Producer | Consumer |
|---|---|---|---|
| Decision logic | **DMN** | cpg-ingester | acp-writer |
| Recommendations | **cpg-contracts** (`Recommendation`, `RecommendationBundle`) | cpg-ingester | acp-writer (vector store) |
| Patient data | **FHIR** (IPS) | mock-EHR | acp-writer |
| Care plans | **FHIR** (CarePlan) | acp-writer | mock-EHR |
| Process automation | **BPMN** | acp-writer | automation |

Producers must not assume a specific consumer runtime. Consumers are pluggable behind the standard.

### Deployment

- Each component owns its own deployment artifacts (Dockerfiles, manifests, Helm charts, etc.).
- A root-level deployment file (e.g., docker-compose) is allowed only as a thin wrapper that references component-level deployments.

## Development Rules

### Code Quality
- Do not introduce security vulnerabilities (OWASP top 10). This project handles clinical data.
- Keep components independent. Avoid adding cross-component dependencies unless the contract goes through `shared/`.
- Prefer standard interfaces (MCP, REST, FHIR, DMN, BPMN) over proprietary integrations.

### Observability
- All new functions that perform meaningful work (API calls, LLM invocations, data transformations, external service calls) must be traced with `@mlflow.trace`. This is not optional.
- `acp-writer` uses `mlflow.fastapi.autolog()` for endpoint tracing and `mlflow.langchain.autolog()` for LangGraph pipeline tracing.
- `cpg-ingester` uses `mlflow.langchain.autolog()` for automatic LangGraph/LLM call tracing.
- Set `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` in environment configuration for both local (compose.yml) and OpenShift (Helm chart) deployments.
- See `platform/mlflow/README.md` for the full tracing inventory.

### Documentation
- `docs/` contains user-facing documentation (architecture, security, deployment guides). Keep this up to date when making changes that affect how the system works or is deployed.
- `dev_docs/` contains internal development documents (design docs, spikes, project plan). Point-in-time references — may not reflect current state.
- Each component has its own README describing its purpose, setup, and usage.
- Use **Mermaid** for all diagrams in documentation. Do not use ASCII art, image files, or external diagramming tools for new diagrams.
