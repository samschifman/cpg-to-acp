"""Multi-round revision-flow harness (issue #169 F18).

Drives the REAL split-path compose pipeline (`llm_reasoning._compose_pipeline`:
composer → internal brief-review loop → conflict analyst → directive
enforcement) through multiple clinician review rounds — locally, with no
SonataFlow, no MinIO, and no cluster deploy.

Two layers:

1. **Structural tests (always run).** The three LLM roles are scripted fakes,
   so the tests assert the *process*: the clinician-directives section survives
   internal review iterations (THE F18 regression), the revision base evolves
   to the latest draft, enforcement retries and then flags, and multi-round
   continuity holds.

2. **Live test / driver (LLM-gated).** With ``LLM_BASE_URL`` (or legacy
   ``LITELLM_URL``) set, `test_live_two_rounds` runs the pipeline against a
   real model over the HTN+DM2 fixture guidelines: author → "resolve all
   conflicts according to suggestions" → assert every directed conflict is
   resolved or the brief is honestly flagged. Run interactively with:

       cd acp-writer && LLM_BASE_URL=... LLM_MODEL=... LLM_API_KEY=... \
           python -m tests.test_revision_flow
