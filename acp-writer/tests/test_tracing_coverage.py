"""F13: meaningful conflict-path functions must carry @mlflow.trace.

AGENTS.md requires every function doing meaningful work (data transformations,
external calls) to be traced. These conflict read-back / provenance / normalize
functions were previously untraced. ``mlflow.trace`` marks the wrapped callable
with ``__mlflow_traced__`` — assert it is present.
