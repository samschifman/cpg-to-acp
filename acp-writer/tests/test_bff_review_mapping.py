"""Regression tests for care-plan review routing/derivation.

The UI + contract (bff-openapi.yaml) submit ReviewAction with a `decision`
field. The workflow switch and this mapper must key on `decision` — an earlier
`action` mismatch made every review fall through to the default (WriteFHIR),
so rejecting a plan silently wrote it. See CheckCarePlanReview in
acp-writer-workflow.yaml.

request_changes loops back to ComposePlan (not GenerateBundle): goals and
activities are decided in the planning brief, so the plan is only actually
revised by re-composing with the clinician's feedback. These tests pin the
mapper's view of where the loop is.
