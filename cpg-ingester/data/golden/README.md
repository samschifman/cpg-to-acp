# Golden DMN corpus

These models are the hand-derived yardstick for the DMN generation benchmark.
They use DMN 1.4, CDATA for FEEL text, `definitions/@id` equal to
`decision_model_id(name)`, and a per-model target namespace beginning with
`https://redhat.com/cpg-to-acp/dmn/`. A multi-output decision uses
`variable/@typeRef="Any"`; the output columns carry the individual types.
Clinical sign-off happens in PR review. These files are the ingester's reference
corpus; they are not bundled into the decision service.

Each row below is one DMN rule. The input and output cells are shown in table
order. `Assumption:` is deliberately literal in the final column because the
benchmark manifest uses it to exclude non-source branches from fidelity scores.

## Treatment Recommendation (`treatment-recommendation.dmn`)

| rule_2 | `>= 130, true, false` | `Start medication; Lisinopril; 10 mg daily; 2` | `synthetic-hypertension-cpg.md:86` “\| >= 130 \| Yes \| No \| Start medication \| Lisinopril \| 10 mg daily \| 2 \|” | Direct transcription. |

| rule_5 | `[130..139], false, false` | `Lifestyle modification only; -; -; 8` | `synthetic-hypertension-cpg.md:89` “\| 130-139 \| No \| No \| Lifestyle modification only \| — \| — \| 8 \|” | The source's inclusive integer range is represented as `[130..139]`. |
| rule_6 | `< 130, false, false` | `Lifestyle modification only; -; -; 12` | `synthetic-hypertension-cpg.md:90` “\| < 130 \| No \| No \| Lifestyle modification only \| — \| — \| 12 \|” | Direct transcription. |
| rule_7 | `< 130, true, false` | `Lifestyle modification only; -; -; 12` | `synthetic-hypertension-cpg.md:91` “\| < 130 \| Yes \| No \| Lifestyle modification only \| — \| — \| 12 \|” | Direct transcription. |
| rule_8 | `< 130, false, true` | `Lifestyle modification only; -; -; 12` | `synthetic-hypertension-cpg.md:92` “\| < 130 \| No \| Yes \| Lifestyle modification only \| — \| — \| 12 \|” | Direct transcription. |
| rule_9 | `< 130, true, true` | `Lifestyle modification only; -; -; 12` | `synthetic-hypertension-cpg.md:99` “Patients with elevated but sub-hypertensive blood pressure (SBP < 130) should focus on lifestyle modifications with follow-up in 12 weeks.” | Assumption: the source principle covers this missing comorbidity combination; the row completes the input space. |

## Monitoring Plan (`monitoring-plan.dmn`)

| Rule id | Input cells | Output cells | Source (file:line, quoted sentence or table row) | Assumptions / notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| rule_1 | `"Start medication", true` | `Basic Metabolic Panel; 2` | `synthetic-hypertension-cpg.md:113` “\| Start medication \| Yes \| Basic Metabolic Panel \| 2 \|” | Direct transcription. |
| rule_2 | `"Start medication", false` | `Basic Metabolic Panel; 4` | `synthetic-hypertension-cpg.md:114` “\| Start medication \| No \| Basic Metabolic Panel \| 4 \|” | Direct transcription. |
| rule_3 | `"Lifestyle modification only", true` | `-; null` | `synthetic-hypertension-cpg.md:115` “\| Lifestyle modification only \| Yes \| — \| — \|” | Direct transcription; null means no lab timing. |

## Glycemic Treatment Decision (`diabetes-treatment.dmn`)

| Rule id | Input cells | Output cells | Source (file:line, quoted sentence or table row) | Assumptions / notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| rule_combination | `>= 9` | `Combination therapy` | `synthetic-diabetes-cpg.md:21` “\| >= 9 \| Combination therapy \|” | Direct transcription; HbA1c is percent. |

|---|---|---|---|---|
| rule_escalate_combination | `"Metformin plus lifestyle", >= 2` | `Escalate to combination therapy` | `synthetic-diabetes-cpg.md:48` “\| Metformin plus lifestyle \| >= 2 \| Escalate to combination therapy \|” | Direct transcription; extraction uses LOINC `4548-4` as an explicit implementation assumption because the CPG names HbA1c but no code. |
| rule_continue_current | `"Metformin plus lifestyle", < 2` | `Continue current plan and reassess at the next scheduled interval` | `synthetic-diabetes-cpg.md:49` “\| Metformin plus lifestyle \| < 2 \| Continue current plan and reassess at the next scheduled interval \|” | Direct transcription. |

## Adult Lipoprotein Screening and Nonfasting Follow-up (`adult-lipoprotein-screening.dmn`)

| Rule id | Input cells | Output cells | Source (file:line, quoted sentence or table row) | Assumptions / notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| rule_1 | `>= 20, -, true, >= 200, -` | `Obtain follow-up fasting lipoprotein profile` | `atp-iii-cholesterol-cpg.md:218` “In all adults aged 20 years or older, a fasting lipoprotein profile (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride) should be obtained once every 5 years. If the testing opportunity is nonfasting, only the values for total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol will be usable. In such a case, if total cholesterol is ≥ 200 mg/dL or HDL is &lt;40 mg/dL, a followup lipoprotein profile is needed for  appropriate management based on LDL.” | Direct transcription; cholesterol values are mg/dL. |

| rule_4 | `>= 20, < 5, false, -, -` | `No routine test currently due` | `atp-iii-cholesterol-cpg.md:218` “...should be obtained once every 5 years.” | Assumption: the complement of the stated interval is treated as not currently due. There is no extraction primitive for time since the last observation. |
| rule_5 | `>= 20, -, true, < 200, >= 40` | `No follow-up fasting profile required` | `atp-iii-cholesterol-cpg.md:218` “If the testing opportunity is nonfasting, only the values for total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol will be usable.” | Assumption: the source is silent on this nonfasting normal branch, so it is given an explicit neutral outcome. |

| rule_3 | `>= 60` | `High` | `atp-iii-cholesterol-cpg.md:235` “\| ≥ 60 \| High \|” | Direct transcription. |

## Triglyceride Classification (`triglyceride-classification.dmn`)
